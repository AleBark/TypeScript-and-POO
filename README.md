# TypeScript-and-POO

This is a small project to remember the basics of some key concepts in MVC like classes, inheritance, generics, and a few more things, using typescript.

By the way: the code inside the dist folder has been translated automatically to ES5 by the typescript compiler, if you're interested, it's cool to see how js deals with some aspects of OOP using prototypes

This code was created using the lessons learned in the TS + Angular course, created by Jorge Sant Ana, available at udemy.com
